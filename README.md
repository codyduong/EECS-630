## Lab 01
The Quicksort implementation is in [`./Lab01/MyQuicksort_3050266.hpp`](./Lab01/MyQuicksort_c766d913.hpp).

Everything else is already provided except for [`./Lab01/Implementation/](./Lab01/Implementation/), which contains any generated output/log files.
There is a convenience shellscript at [`./Lab01/Implementation/test.sh`](./Lab01/Implementation/test.sh) to help run all the tests.
