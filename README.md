# EECS-630

Taken with [Dr. Cuncong Zhong](https://web.archive.org/web/https://eecs.ku.edu/people/cuncong-zhong) in Spring 2024.

The output from running test results for each lab/homework is stored in [`./Lab##/Implementation/`](./Lab01/Implementation/), 
which contains any generated output/log files. It also contains a shellscript [`./Lab##/Implementation/test.sh`](./Lab01/Implementation/test.sh)
to help run the [`./Lab##/GradingScript.py`](./Lab01/GradingScript.py) for all the test cases (0-10).

## Grades
Note there are only 4 labs instead of 5, due to time limitations in the semester.
