# EECS-630

The output from running test results for each lab/homework is stored in [`./Lab##/Implementation/`](./Lab01/Implementation/), 
which contains any generated output/log files. It also contains a shellscript [`./Lab##/Implementation/test.sh`](./Lab01/Implementation/test.sh)
to help run the [`./Lab##/GradingScript.py`](./Lab01/GradingScript.py) for all the test cases (0-10).
